This is an API consumption experiment

We first create an account at Twilio
We generate a Twilio number to be used for sending the messages
Using the Twilio site, we add a list of phone numbers to send messages to. This is because we are using a free account.
We then create a php file and initialize the sid(Standard ID) and an authentication token
Finally, we sent messages to verified numbers :)
